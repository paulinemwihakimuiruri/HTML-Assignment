    <h1 style="color: blueviolet;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">My Two Weeks Experience At AkiraChix</h1>
    <p style="color: black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I came to AkiraChix on March 9th 2025. On arrival I was warmly welcomed to the institution by the manager Miss. Linda Kamau who took me through the objectives of codeHive program and what to expect at the end of it. Since I was a few days late I got to catch up with the rest of the class before the beginning of the week. </p>
   <p style="color: black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">From the moment that I got to AkiraChix till now has been a whole new and wonderful experience. I have had the opportunity to interact with other girls from different countries in and out of class who also aspire to work in the Tech industry. The environment here is serene and breathtaking as well.</p>

   <h2 style="color: blue;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Positive Experiences</h2>
   <p style="color: black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I've had my fair share of experiences so far but i'm glad that in my case the good experiences are more than the bad ones. Some of them include:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Having friendly colleagues.</li>
    <li>Having good and understanding trainers.</li>
    <li>A very healthy diet.</li>
    <li>Comfortable rooms to sleep in.</li>
    <li>Access to everything I need during my time here.</li>
    <li>Games</li>

   <h2 style="color: blue;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Negative Experiences</h2>
   <p style="color: black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Life in AkiraChix hasn't been all sunshine and flowers. I've had some not so good moments as well like;</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Having to adapt to a new environment</li>
    <li>Adapting to a specific schedule</li>
    <li>Harsh weather</li>
   </ul>

   <p style="color: black;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Overall every day has become a learning day to discover something new and i'm loving it.</p>
